If you have worked on setting up an API connection in the past, this should be fairly straightforward. Else read through this section. 

In order to extract any data from Reddit, the first step is to create an app where you provide authentication details to mine Reddit
data on your local systems. It uses the OAuth verification methodology, hence it is easier to implement and call from the local machine.

1. After landing on the Reddit Homepage, find the prefernce tab (in the older version it is on the top right corner besides the user info).
2. Now select the apps tab to create a new app.
3. Provide a unique name for your app. 
4. Select the Scipts if it's a bespoke request. Otherwise if you are looking to deploy it on top of an app or a Web aplication, select your
   option appropriately. I'll be covering the script version here only.
5. You can leave the about url and the rediret uri fields blank or use the address for local hosts here: http://localhost:8080.
6. Upon creation of the app you need to copy the client id and the secret key that is assigned to the app. These will be used in python to
 authenticate and establish connection  with Reddit.
